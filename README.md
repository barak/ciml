# Fix typo or mistake

If you find typo or mistake, please help me to fix it right there. Don't just create an issue. You can save my time if you propose file change by creating pull-request with a fix. How to do it?

Just click on the pencil icon (edit file in your fork of the project) in the right top corner while viewing a file. Fix typo and fill in the form at the bottom of the page adding a description to the change. Press 'Propose file change'. Done!

I will review the diff of the change and if it's good I just need to press "Merge" button to update this book.

Thanks for your contribution!
